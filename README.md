## General Information
After the COVID-19 quarantine began, my brotherâ€™s classes were very limited and he was only able to talk to his teacher twice a week online. It was much more difficult to keep up with his assignments, especially since many of them were optional and there was little guidance.

In order to address this problem, I designed and programmed a personalized application using Java that keeps track of both his school assignments and household tasks. The main functionality of the application is the task log, which allows the student to see upcoming assignments based on due date and category. The application also had a separate parent menu to allow the parents or supervisor easily monitor his progress or edit his tasks. Both the student's menu and the parent's menu have the option of looking at completion data over time.
