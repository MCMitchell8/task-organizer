# Task Organizer
Task organizer for learning during quarantine. Designed for child and parent.

## General Information
After the COVID-19 quarantine began, my younger brotherâ€™s classes were very limited and he was only able to talk to his teacher twice a week online. It became much more difficult for him to keep up with assignments since there was little guidance.

In order to address this problem, I designed and programmed a personalized application using Java that keeps track of both his school assignments and household tasks. The main functionality of the application is the task log, which allows the student to see upcoming assignments based on due date and category. The application also has a separate parent menu to allow the parents or supervisor to easily monitor his progress or edit his tasks. Both the student's menu and the parent's menu have the option of looking at completion data over time.
